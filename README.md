# The Developers Arena
**A Journey Through Data Science**

A collection of projects I completed during my journey of learning **Data Science**.  
Each week represents a new milestone in building strong foundations and practical skills in this ever-evolving field.

## Weekly Progress

### **Week 1:**
**Basics of Python**  
A crucial first step in any Data Science journey, the fundamentals of Python, the most essential language for data analysis and machine learning.   

### **Week 2:**  
**Making Decisions & Repeating Tasks**  
Diving deeper into logic building with if-else conditions, loops, functions, and a project-based Student Grade Calculator with feedback messages.

### **Week 3:**  
**Introduction to Data Analysis**  
Explored the basics of working with real-world data using the Pandas library—loading datasets cleaning data, handling missing values, and performing simple statistical analysis. 
The project for this week focused on analyzing a sales dataset to compute total sales, identify the best-selling product, and generate a simple report summarizing the findings.
